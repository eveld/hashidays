This demo will guide you through migrating an application from a monolithic application running on a virtual machine to microservices running on Kubernetes, using Consul Service Mesh.

## Prerequisites
- Docker (https://docker.com/get-started)
- Shipyard (https://shipyard.run/docs/install)

## Getting started
To start the demo, run the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/eveld/hashidays.git
cd hashidays
shipyard run
```

Shipyard will open the documentation in your browser automatically.
The rest of the steps will be explained in further detail there.
